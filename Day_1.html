					Unfortuantly I lost my first html file for my blog. This is my attempt at recreating it outside of a classroom setting. It was kind of a bummer, I was hoping that I could recover it from Git but I must have made a mistake commiting it becuase there was no history of changes for the file, let alone the first version I created last week.
				</p>
				<p>
					That being said this is a great opporuntity to really create some muscle memory and be able to write out the code again. At least by the end of the second version I will be more comfortable with language. I also now understand how to use Git, I spoke to a friend of mine who uses the software at his office. He was able to shed some light on the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, same as before this entire process is proving to be very rewarding and extremly fun. I really am finding joy in typing out code and creating a webpage. I look forward to seeing where I am by the end of the course. After I hope to take the iOS bootcamp - really looking forward to that.
