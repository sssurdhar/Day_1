					<strong>Unfortuantly I lost my first html file for my blog.</strong> This is my attempt at recreating it outside of a classroom setting. It was kind of a bummer, I was hoping that I could recover it from Git but I must have made a <em>mistake</em> commiting it becuase there was no history of changes for the file, let alone the first version I created last week.
				</p>
				<p>
					That being said this is a great opporuntity to really create some muscle memory and be able to write out the code again. At least by the end of the second version I will be more comfortable with language. <strong>I also now understand how to use Git</strong>, I spoke to a friend of mine who uses the software at his office. He was able to shed some light on the issue.
				</p>
				<p class:"paragraphThree">
					Anyway, same as before this entire process is proving to be very rewarding and <em>extremely</em> fun. I really am finding joy in typing out code and creating a webpage. I look forward to seeing where I am by the end of the course. <span style="color: white;">After I hope to take the iOS bootcamp - really looking forward to that.</span>
